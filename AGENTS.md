# Business Project

This is a VLTRA business project for research, writing, and strategic work.

## Knowledge Base

_Run `/onboard` to populate the knowledge base through a conversational interview._

| File                 | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `about/company.md`   | Identity, industry, story       |
| `about/products.md`  | Offerings, differentiators      |
| `about/customers.md` | Audience, personas, pain points |
| `about/voice.md`     | Tone, terminology, glossary     |
| `about/goals.md`     | Current priorities, challenges  |

## How It Works

1. **Run `/onboard` first** - Teaches the AI about your business through conversation
2. **Use other commands** - They read `AGENTS.md` and follow pointers for context
3. **Re-run `/onboard` anytime** - Update context as your business evolves
4. **Run `/tidy`** - Audit and reorganize the knowledge base

`AGENTS.md` is the stable entry point — all skills navigate through its index. `about/` is the default starting structure. As the project grows, files can be reorganized into whatever fits. The index always reflects the current layout.

## Git Workflow

All work happens on `main`. The AI commits autonomously at logical checkpoints. You don't need to manage git.

## Tips

- **Be conversational** - Talk naturally, not in formal requests
- **Iterate freely** - Ask for changes, refinements, different angles
- **Context matters** - The more the AI knows about your business, the better the output
